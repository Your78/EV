        These are the factors, which affect the Environment more.This percentages are taken from the survey of 2022.In 2023, it will be changed. So, it's not sure that it will be same in 2023 and future. 
        But, it is definitely sure that these percentage will increase in future, but not decrease in future according to many researchers.
        If people and every country take some steps to stop it, then it will be possible that it can decrease.

        In the present time, we can see that deterioration of the Environment is increasing very sharply as compared to the past.
        Because of this, many species and humans are also facing many problems.
        Some species are not available in some country at that time, while in past they were present.
        More and more prople are facing health related problems, like cancer and breathing problems and so on.
        Additionally, life expectency of people is decreasing day by day and also the strenght.

        Nowadays, most of individuals want to save their time. So, they also use their own vehicles rather than public transportation.
        Most of people need to make their life very easier.They use many devicies and new technologies but, all the technologies are no environment friendly. 
        Thus, people should avoid to use it and use environment friedly gadgets. They should understand and think about the environment instead of only their benefits.

        In the present time, we all know that competition is increasing day by day.Each and every country want to make better than ohter countries.
        They all think that if they make their own new technology and new things, then they become more powerful and richer.
        But, in the compitition, sometimes the forgot that they should be aware about the environment.
        For their bnefits, they cut the trees and become the danger of some species. After they don't plant and grow trees again.
        As a result, the number of trees are decreasing and its responsible for the deforesting.
