        <h2>About The Atmosphere</h2>
        <P>
            There are four layer in the Environment.<br>
            1)Troposphere<br>
            2)Stratosphere<br>
            3)Mesosphere<br>
            4)Thermosphere<br>
            <br></P>
            <hr size="1">
            <h3>1.Troposphere</h3>
            <p>
                The troposphere is the layer that we live in.It starts at ground lavel and extends about 12km upwards.<br>
            In this layer, there are two most significant gases, 78% is Nitrogen and 21% is Oxygen.</p>
            <hr size="1">
            <h3>2.Stratosphere</h3>
            <p>
                The Stratosphere is from 12km to 50km upwards. Airplanes trevel in this layer, when they travel from West to East.It helps the planes to move faster.<br>
                The Ozone layer is also available in this layer. Ozone layer save the earth from UV rays. It is the biggest benefit for the earth. 
            </p>
            <hr size="1">
            <h3>3.Mesosphere</h3>
            <p>
                The Mesosphere is the coldest region of Earth's atmosphere. It's somewhere close to 100 degree Celsius.In the mesosphere, scientist send unmanned balloons to measure the temperature. <br>
                This layer also protects the Earth from large meteoroids. The friction within this layer causes meteors to burn up. 
            </p>
            <hr size="1">
            <h3>4.Thermosphere</h3>
            <p>

                The Thermosphere is the thickest layer in the atmosphere, which starts from about 80km to going upwards. At this layer temperature can reach up to 1500 degreesCelsius or more.<br>
                Moreover, the Thermoshere has its 2 own layer, Ionosphere and Exosphere.
            </p>
            <hr size="1">
            All this Four layers are very crucial for the Earth and also for all the individuals. Furthermore, there are many other gases are available like, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Hydrogen and so on. But, these are available in little amount.
